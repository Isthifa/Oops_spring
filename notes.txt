Abstraction->
hiding internal implemention and just highlight set of services what we are offering is concept of abstraction
Eg-: ATM Screen set of services offering

Outside person cant see internal implementation
-Security - Top priority
-Enhancement become easy - without effection end user we can change internal 
-Improves easyness to use our system
-maintain ability will be improved


Encapsulation->
the process of binding the data members and behaviour(method) in single unit 
by declaring private we can achive data hiding 
-> data hiding + abstraction
->secuirty


inheritance-> extends keyword
--->Advantage Reuseability of code 
--->Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object

<-whatever methods parent as by default available to child ->

<-child specifie method by default not available to parent->

parent references we can hold child class but we cant access child method

eg :-
class A
{
 public void m1()
{
}
}
class B extends A
{
public void m2()
{
}
}

main class 
main method
A a=new A()
a.m2; error;
